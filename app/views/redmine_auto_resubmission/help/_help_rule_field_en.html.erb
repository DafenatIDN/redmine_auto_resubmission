The syntax of the resubmission-rule consists of three to four parameters: 
</p>

<pre>
1. parameter: epoch-identifier

 D - stands for _D_ays
 W - stands for _W_eeks
 m - stands for _m_ondays
 M - stands for _M_onths
 q - stands for _q_uarters
 Y - stands for _Y_ears

2. parameter: integer

 n - stands for the number of epochs
 
3. position of day within epoch 

 F - stands for _F_irst day of epoch, like first day of month, monday, first day of 
     quarter, or January 1st
 M - stands for _M_id of epoch, like 15th day of month, wednesday, 15th of 
     mid-of-quarter or June 30th
 L - stands for _L_ast of epoch, like last day of month, friday (last working day),
     last day of quarter or December 31st
 W - stands for _W_eekday (Monday), if calculated day falls on a Saturday or Sunday
 X - stands for no correction

3. control of date calculation

 - - the sign "-" is a killswitch. After one date calculation the resubmission rule is 
     deleted, so no further resubmissions happen
 ! - the sign "!" is a force sign to force date calculation even if a resubmission date
     present
 * - the sign "*" is a mock switch. The mock-switch is deleted from the resubmission-rule
     and no resubmission-date is calculated. Needed for Redmine Attribute-Quickie plugin
     
     The control signs must be present in the above order, namely: - ! *. Any arbitrary
     subset of the control signs or all of the three control signs may be omitted.
     
Example: W1F - one week further, first day, so monday 
Example: M3M - three months further from today, mid-day, so 15th of month
Example: q1- - next quarter, first day of quarter, so 1st Jan., Apr., Jul. or Oct., after
               one calculation further calculations are stopped, riule is deleted.
Example: D1- - tomorrow, then delete rule 
Example: D1-! - tomorrow!, even if a resubmission-date is present in the 
               resubmission-date-field
               
Resubmission dates are always calculated for the future, never for the past. 
So W0F would calculate "next monday"", if calculated on a friday, though W0 stands for 
this week (W0 zero weeks further, first day, monday) and would calculate last monday. 
In this case, the calculated date is advanced monday further into the future.
So q0M would calculate "next quarter mid-term" if calculated near to lapse of current 
quarter. In this case the calculated date is advanced one quarter into the future.
